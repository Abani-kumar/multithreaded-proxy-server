## ✨ Key Features

- **Universal Domain Support**: Handles requests to any valid web domain.
- **Intelligent LRU Caching**: Optimizes response times with smart caching.
- **Advanced Thread Management**: Custom implementation using semaphores.
- **Memory-Efficient Design**: Optimized memory allocation for cache storage.
- **Real-Time Performance Metrics**: Built-in monitoring of cache hits/misses.

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### 🔹 Thread Pool Management

Implements a sophisticated thread management system using semaphores instead of traditional condition variables:

```c
sem_t mutex;
sem_t thread_slots;
```

### 🔹 Custom LRU Caching

Custom LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementation with **O(1) lookup time**:

```c
struct CacheNode {
    char* url;
    char* data;
    size_t size;
    struct CacheNode* prev;
    struct CacheNode* next;
};
```

### 🔹 HTTP Request Handling

- Robust HTTP request parsing.
- Forwarding mechanism with intelligent response caching.
- Connection keep-alive support for optimized performance.
